**Installation**
To get started with the project, first clone the repository:

Bash: 
git clone https://github.com/Charan3uu/online-payment-fraud-detect.git

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

**Navigate to the project folder:**
bash
cd online-payment-fraud-detect
Install the required Python libraries. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

The project is primarily structured around a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to train a machine learning model to detect online payment fraud.

**Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
bash
jupyter notebook
Navigate to fraud_detection.ipynb to see the code for training the model using Logistic Regression on the dataset.

Run the notebook cell by cell to observe the data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and results.

**The steps include:**

Data Loading: Importing and cleaning the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding the data.
Model Training: Implementing Logistic Regression to train on the data.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language used for the project.
Jupyter Notebook: The environment for writing and executing code.
Logistic Regression: The machine learning algorithm used to detect fraud.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-Learn: Machine learning library used for building and evaluating the Logistic Regression model.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization tools for plotting graphs and charts.
